ShelterFirst is an SMS messaging platform for homeless individuals to locate nearby shelters. 
The service accepts user location and preferences as input, and provides directions to the closest shelter that matches their needs. 
Administrators can update shelter services and availability using our web front-end. 

ShelterFirst was built using the Twilio API, Node.js webhooks, Express.js, Google Cloud Platform's Directions API, HTML, SASS, and JavaScript.
